## Introduction:

THE parity generator is the method to chek the error present while transmitting data from the transmitter node to
the receiver node. Parity generator is of two types they are odd parity generator and the even parity generator.
The reversible logic gates are used in the generation of the parity generator and for the parity checker. This is
done using the reversible logic gates since the reversible logic gates are non- information loss gates. This parity
generating technique is the most efficient technique and is one of the most widely used in the error detection
techniques for the data transmission. This generation and the checking of the parity of the bits are performed by the
method of the reversible logic gate makes the data transmission much easier than the conventional methods. This use
of the reversible logic gates reduces the loss of information, delay and the number of gates used. Reversible logic
enables the circuit to perform the retival of the information easily by using the garbage values in the reversible gates.


# Parity generator

Parity bits are extra signals which are added to a data word to enable error checking. There are two types of Parity -
even and odd. An even parity generator will produce a logic 1 at its output if the data word contains an odd number of
ones. If the data word contains an even number of ones then the output of the parity generator will be low. 

# Even parity Generator for 3 bit :
Let us assume that a 3-bit message is to be transmitted with an even parity bit. Let the three inputs A, B and C are applied to the circuit and output bit is the parity bit P. The total number of 1s must be even, to generate the even parity bit P.

The figure below shows the truth table of even parity generator in which 1 is placed as parity bit in order to make all 1s as even when the number of 1s in the truth table is odd.

Te K-map simplification for 3-bit message even parity generator is

# Logic expression :
From the above truth table, the simplified expression of the parity bit can be written as

![exp](/even-parity-generator-exp.jpg)

The above expression can be implemented by using two Ex-OR gates. The logic diagram of even parity generator with two Ex – OR gates is shown below. The three bit message along with the parity generated by this circuit which is transmitted to the receiving end where parity checker circuit checks whether any error is present or not.

To generate the even parity bit for a 4-bit data, three Ex-OR gates are required to add the 4-bits and their sum will be the parity bit.

# Odd Parity Generator :

Let us consider that the 3-bit data is to be transmitted with an odd parity bit. The three inputs are A, B and C and P is the output parity bit. The total number of bits must be odd in order to generate the odd parity bit.

In the given truth table below, 1 is placed in the parity bit in order to make the total number of bits odd when the total number of 1s in the truth table is even.

The truth table of the odd parity generator can be simplified by using K-map as

The output parity bit expression for this generator circuit is obtained as

                        P = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C)

The above Boolean expression can be implemented by using one Ex-OR gate and one Ex-NOR gate in order to design a 3-bit odd parity generator.

The logic circuit of this generator is shown in below figure, in which two inputs are applied at one Ex-OR gate, and this Ex-OR output and third input is applied to the Ex-NOR gate, to produce the odd parity bit. It is also possible to design this circuit by using two Ex-OR gates and one NOT gate.
